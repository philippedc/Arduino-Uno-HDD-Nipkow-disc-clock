# Arduino-Uno-HDD-Nipkow-disc-clock
This is an example of recycling an old 5'1/4 HDD to a funny 6 digits clock.

This is the primitive mechanical picture show, this one is a 5x72 pixels. Only 6 holes on the disc: 5 for the 5 lines, the 6th is the synchronization detector.

Please read the pdf manual to get some explanation of the builing.
